# Euphoria Patches Changelog 1.3
This version is the biggest update so far, adding so many things it's impossible to sum it up in a message
## Changes
- Updated to Complementary r5.2
- Removed the lava column noise option as it is enabled by default and it just looks too good so there is no need to disable it :p
- Tweaked Purple fire gradient
- Added Renko's Cut of Euphoria Patches by [@gri573](https://github.com/gri573)
- Seasons now start in spring and they are by default now 28 Minecraft days long to match the behaviour of the [fabric seasons mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-seasons)
- Added a starting season option where you can change from which season the cycle starts
- Added Support for many Euphoria Patches features with [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons)
- Added a glitter rain option
- All light level 15 modded light sources (and other light levels with iris 1.7) will automatically work with SSBL now
- All modded cross-model foliage blocks work with SSS and with the new Advanced Colored Lighting system
- Lava lakes in caves under y -55 in the overworld will now also look like the nether lava lakes with the adaptive lava noise preset
- Added separate Border Fog settings (Distance and Density) for all dimensions
- Added glowing raw blocks option
- Added a new end portal effect
- Added a long exposure mode
- Added a tilt-shift option (this is awesome!)
- Interactive foliage has a smoother fallof
- Added A lava edge effect
- The Cloud Height Option now works with Unbound Clouds
- Added Handheld Blocklight Flickering
- Started Adding modded blocks to block.properties
- Added a lava edge setting (only works if ACL is enabled)
- Added Watermark Conditions
- Added an option to view the focus plane of DOF for better control for screenshots. If enabled it is only visible when the GUI is visible, when toggling F1 to take a screenshot it fades away
- [@gri573](https://github.com/gri573) Added an awesome End Crystal Vortex Option (does not work on Mac (requires voxelation) - enables entity shadows)
- The above option also has a healing beam option, only works on an unreleased iris version for now
- Added an ender dragon death animation (does not work on Mac (requires voxelation) - enables entity shadows)
- An atmospheric and lighting multiplier comparison option has been added so people can more easily compare the changes
- Improved the look of Soul Sand Valley Overhaul lava and Purple End Fire Lava, they now look like intended on all lava noise modes.
- Added a cloud render distance slider to control how far or near clouds will appear
- Added an unbound night cloud remover option, because of frequent suggestions :p
- Improved the Epic Thunderstorm option. The contrast is not as drastic anymore. Generated normals now also work with the lightning bolt!
- Added an emissive diamond enchanting table option
- Improved the visuals of crimson nylium and crimson roots with soul sand valley overhaul on.
- Added more information buttons
- Improved details with Soul Sand Valley Overhaul turned on, such as blocklight turning blue even without ACL or SSBL
- Added an SSS toggle
- Removed nether fungi from interactable foliage (for consistency and better looks if 3d RP is used)
- Better Nether and Better End Support was Added by @Acer (Alex)
- Added a new stylistic water style with major help from Helgust for providing the original code
- Improved the look of winter, now foliage is much more dull and dead. A slider was added if one wants to bring back life into them :p
- Sand and moss noise now only work in a distance (configurable) around the player to improve situations where sand gets everywhere. I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
- Stars can be turned off by tweaking the star brightness slider (previous star brightness configs don't break yaaaay)
- Added Emin's cave smoke option for ACL
- Added waving sugar cane option, works better with ACL similar to Waving Nether Vines Emin added
- Added a Noise Coated Textures resolution slider
- Added an option to disable Complementary's Water Tweaks
- Added a modified variant of ACES tonemap which does not turn reds into oranges when very bright, only disadvantage is the loss of detail with the emissive redstone block
- Added modded End fog support. The ender beam and ambient light colors change based on the fog color of a modded end biome, vanilla biomes use the Complementary Colors
- End sky colors also change color in modded biomes now, amount can be changed with a slider
- Added a list of what features are iris exclusive to the information file
- Added Polish translation thanks to @Acer (Alex)
- Added higher values for lava emission, at your own risk
- Added a higher quality clouds option
- And MANY minor changes and probably a lot I forgot
