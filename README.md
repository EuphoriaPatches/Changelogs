- Improved the Faster Rainy Clouds Option, now it has 2 options to choose from, the first one is the current released version, the transition is very fast between clear and rainy weather. And the second one has no transition but clouds and other affected animations will teleport quickly. This can't be fixed, unfortunately. Water and Foliage are also affected now and the option has been renamed to Increased Rain Strength and is now located under the world tab instead of Atmosphere.
- Added a Spooky option which enables many spooky effects and changes the overall look of the shader.
- Added a Cave Lighting Fade option which makes the caves darker with increased distance from the player. Improves the look of caves with a higher Cave Lighting setting.
- Added a dragon egg emission toggle option
- The nether brightness slider has more options now
- Added Vanilla Entity Shadows option (enables the vanilla entity shadow when realtime shadows are disabled)
- The emissive nether wart now looks more organic
- Added a new popular settings category
- Added a SpacEagle17's setting profile
- Improved The Integrated PBR Redstone Option (FINALLY!)
- Flowing Lava noise now flows down, as it is expected to behave. With this addition, the flowing lava noise setting is now good enough in my (SpacEagle17) eyes to be enabled by default.
- Added an extra option to the End Rod Profile menu, where the end rod slowly switches colors over time.

- Added a Froglight saturation setting, which makes the colors of the froglights more defined, this also then makes them affect the lightmap more with Multi-Colored Blocklight enabled.
- Added an option which makes fire in the end purple, similar to the soul sand valley overhaul option

## Fixes
- Fixed Retro outlines with only night vision mode enabled force enabling world outline when not having the night vision effect
- Made lava noise work with labpbr and co, only worked with ipbr before

## Obsolete Options
- Removed blocklight flickering as it is now in the base pack
- Removed Force Glowing Particles Option as it is in the base pack
