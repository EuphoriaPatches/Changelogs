# Latest changes for the next public release

## Changes
- [gri](https://github.com/gri573) added an option to enable flood fill colored blacklight (only works on iris)! This colored blocklight option also works off-screen meaning that light sources hiding behind blocks still create colored lighting. Even emissive blocks can create light. Additionally, hardcoded colors for each blocks have been added as well
